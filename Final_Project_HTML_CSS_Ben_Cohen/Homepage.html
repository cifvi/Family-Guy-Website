                    <u><b>Bio:</b></u> Family Guy is an American animated sitcom created by Seth MacFarlane for
                    Fox.<br />
                    The series centers on the Griffins, a family consisting of parents Peter and Lois; their children,
                    Meg, Chris, and Stewie; and their anthropomorphic pet dog, Brian. The show is set in the fictional
                    city of Quahog that is located in Rhode Island (a place that actually exists), and exhibits much of
                    its humor in the form of metafictional cutaway gags that often lampoon American culture.<br />
                    The family was conceived by MacFarlane after developing two animated films, The Life of Larry and
                    Larry & Steve. MacFarlane redesigned the films' protagonist, Larry, and his dog, Steve, and renamed
                    them Peter and Brian, respectively.<br />
                    MacFarlane pitched a seven-minute pilot to Fox in 1998, and the show was greenlit and began
                    production. Shortly after the third season of Family Guy had aired in 2002, Fox canceled the series
                    with one episode left unaired.<br />
                    Adult Swim aired that episode in 2003, finishing the series' original run. However, favorable DVD
                    sales and high ratings for syndicated reruns on Adult Swim convinced the network to renew the show
                    in 2004 for a fourth season, which began airing on May 1, 2005.<br />
